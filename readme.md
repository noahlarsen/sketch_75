## Randomly-generated Processing art piece with process

A randomly-generated art piece written in Processing. I have attempted to document the process of creation from start to finish. I included pdfs along the way, but have pulled them for the final commit. You can wander back through and check them out as you see fit. Or, better, create your own.

All of these files are free for you to use, print and distribute -- just please don't sell.
